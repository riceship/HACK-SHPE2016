## I'm developing a project called...


## Here's the elevator pitch...
Simple. Basic. Powerful.

Our aim was to build an extremely easy to use method for workers to report their workday conditions and for crew leaders to be able to quickly access this information and make changes as they see fit, while also educating workers on their OSHA rights.

## It's built with...
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Possibly SQL

## The Team
Aida El Kouri, Itzel Cantu, James Patterson, Jacob Diaz

## Web, Mobile App, or Something Else?
Web app designed to work on mobile as well as tablet interfaces.

## Executive Summary -


## Design/Features -
When users first open the web app, they are greeted with the landing page shown below. They may select to either learn more about OSHA regulations or do the daily check in. 


NAME is comprised of two essential features: a daily check in and an osha education part. The daily check in is a short survey workers should fill out at the end of every day. The survey consists of questions about how much water workers have drank, whether they've gone to the bathroom, and how they are feeling. These questions are always open to change and questions more specific to certain farms or workplaces can always be added in. At the end is also an open ended questionwhere workers may voice safety concerns or workplace complaints. The following is a prototype of what the check in looks like.

As you can see, the design is extremely visual and basic. That's the whole intention. With little written words used, people of all backgrounds can interpret the symbols regardless of language barrier. The form was designed to be extremely short as well, so that workers don't feel like it is a chore.

The other crucial feature to the web app is the OSHA Wiki/FAQ. One of the most challenging parts to workers, especially those with limited literacy, is understanding the complicated and confusing legalities of the actual OSHA regulations. Our goal was to simplify some of the key questions workers may have. In addition, after reading the Wiki, they have the option to complete a short quiz which tess their knowledge of the information. This quiz will contain very fundamental ethical rules that workers should know about their workplace rights.
